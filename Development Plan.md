# KYC-MCP Development Plan

## MVP Phase (Sprint 1-2: 2-3 weeks)

**Goal:** Demonstrate basic MCP functionality with core KYC operations

### Core Features for MVP

#### MCP Tool Implementation

- Create basic MCP tools for client and person management
- Implement simple CRUD operations as MCP functions
- Basic search and retrieval capabilities

#### Essential Services & Controllers

- Client management service
- Person management service
- Basic REST endpoints (for testing/debugging)

#### MCP Tools to Implement

- `search_clients` - Find clients by name, type, or risk level
- `get_client_details` - Retrieve full client information with associated persons
- `create_client` - Add new client
- `add_person_to_client` - Associate person with client
- `get_high_risk_clients` - Retrieve all high-risk clients

### User Stories (MVP)

- As an AI agent, I can search for clients by various criteria
- As an AI agent, I can retrieve detailed client information including associated persons
- As an AI agent, I can identify high-risk clients for compliance review
- As an AI agent, I can add new clients and persons to the system

### Technical Tasks

- Create ClientService and PersonService
- Implement MCP tool classes using Spring AI MCP annotations
- Create DTOs for MCP responses
- Add basic error handling and validation
- Create integration tests for MCP tools
- Update application configuration for MCP tools registration

## Development Guidelines

### Sprint Structure (2-week sprints)

- Sprint Planning (Day 1)
- Daily standups
- Sprint Review & Demo (Day 9)
- Sprint Retrospective (Day 10)

### Definition of Done
