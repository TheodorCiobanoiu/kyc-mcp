# Product Requirements Document: KYC-MCP Proof of Concept

**Author:** Gemini
**Date:** 2025-07-19
**Version:** 0.1 (Proof of Concept)

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a Proof of Concept (PoC) of the **Know Your Customer - Multi-turn
Conversation Protocol (KYC-MCP)** application. The project aims to build a backend system that exposes core KYC
functionalities through a set of tools compatible with AI agents and Large Language Models (LLMs). This will enable an
AI agent to act as a compliance assistant, performing tasks like client data retrieval, creation, and basic risk
assessment.

### 1.2. Problem Statement

Compliance officers in the fintech industry spend significant time on manual, repetitive tasks for KYC procedures. An
AI-powered assistant could streamline these workflows, but it requires a robust, tool-based interface to interact with
the underlying KYC data systems safely and efficiently.

### 1.3. Target Audience

The primary user for this PoC is an **AI Agent** (e.g., Gemini, Claude). The ultimate end-user is a **Compliance Officer
** who would interact with the AI agent to manage their KYC workload.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

The primary goal of this PoC is to **demonstrate the feasibility and value of using an MCP-driven approach for core KYC
operations.**

### Key Objectives:

- **Validate Core Functionality:** Prove that essential KYC tasks (client search, creation, data retrieval) can be
  successfully executed by an AI agent via MCP tools.
- **Establish a Foundation:** Create a stable, well-defined service layer and data model that can be extended in future
  phases.
- **Assess AI Interaction:** Showcase a clean, intuitive, and effective tool-based API for AI agent integration.

## 3. Scope

### 3.1. In-Scope Features (PoC)

The scope of this PoC is strictly limited to the features defined in the MVP phase of the development plan.

| User Story                                                                 | Feature/MCP Tool                                                                                                                             |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| As an AI agent, I can search for clients by various criteria.              | **`search_clients`**: A tool to find clients by name, client type, or risk level.                                                            |
| As an AI agent, I can retrieve detailed client information.                | **`get_client_details`**: A tool to fetch a client's complete profile, including all associated persons.                                     |
| As an AI agent, I can add new clients and associate individuals with them. | **`create_client`**: A tool to add a new client to the system.<br>**`add_person_to_client`**: A tool to link a person to an existing client. |
| As an AI agent, I can identify high-risk clients for compliance review.    | **`get_high_risk_clients`**: A tool to retrieve a list of all clients currently classified as high-risk.                                     |

### 3.2. Out-of-Scope Features

All features planned for subsequent phases are explicitly out of scope for this PoC, including but not limited to:

- Advanced search and reporting (e.g., `generate_risk_summary`).
- Document management (uploading, listing, validation).
- Automated risk scoring engines.
- External data integrations (e.g., sanctions screening, PEP checks).
- Case management and workflow automation.

## 4. Requirements

### 4.1. Functional Requirements

The system shall provide the following MCP tools with the described functionality:

- **`search_clients(name: string, type: ClientType, riskLevel: RiskLevel)`**:
    - **Input**: One or more optional search parameters (name, type, risk).
    - **Output**: A list of `ClientDTO` objects matching the criteria.
- **`get_client_details(clientId: UUID)`**:
    - **Input**: A unique client identifier.
    - **Output**: A single `ClientDTO` object containing the client's full details and a list of associated `PersonDTO`
      objects.
- **`create_client(request: CreateClientRequest)`**:
    - **Input**: A `CreateClientRequest` DTO containing the necessary information for a new client.
    - **Output**: The newly created `ClientDTO`.
- **`add_person_to_client(clientId: UUID, request: CreatePersonRequest)`**:
    - **Input**: The target client's ID and a `CreatePersonRequest` DTO for the new person.
    - **Output**: The updated `ClientDTO` with the new person included.
- **`get_high_risk_clients()`**:
    - **Input**: None.
    - **Output**: A list of `ClientDTO` objects where `riskLevel` is `HIGH`.

### 4.2. Technical Requirements

- The application will be built using Java/Spring Boot.
- Core business logic will be encapsulated in `ClientService` and `PersonService`.
- Data will be persisted in a relational database.
- Basic data validation will be implemented for all inputs.
- The MCP tools will be implemented using the Spring AI MCP framework.

## 5. Assumptions

- The AI agent (MCP client) is capable of making structured tool calls.
- Basic client, person, and risk level data models are sufficient for the PoC.
- For the PoC, a simple, predefined set of `ClientType`, `RelationshipType`, and `RiskLevel` enums is acceptable.

## 6. Success Criteria

The Proof of Concept will be considered successful when the following criteria are met:

1. All five MCP tools (`search_clients`, `get_client_details`, `create_client`, `add_person_to_client`,
   `get_high_risk_clients`) are implemented and functional.
2. An AI agent can successfully call each tool and receive a valid, structured response.
3. A developer can demonstrate a simple end-to-end workflow (e.g., create a client, add a person, search for the client,
   retrieve its details) using an MCP-compatible client.
4. The API is clean, documented, and showcases the core value of the KYC domain.
5. All integration tests for the MCP tools pass successfully.
